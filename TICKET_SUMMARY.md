# Dataset Management Feature Tickets Summary

## Overview
This document outlines 9 tickets for implementing a comprehensive local dataset management system for the Summon application playground. The system allows users to save conversation history as datasets, manage them through a sidebar interface, and load them back into playground tabs.

## Feature Breakdown

### Core Features
1. **Save message history** - Users can save playground conversations as local datasets
2. **Dataset management** - Sidebar section with dataset list, search, and CRUD operations  
3. **Load to playground** - Load saved datasets into new playground tabs

### Enhancement Features
4. **Advanced actions** - Import/export, batch operations, multiple formats
5. **Error handling** - Comprehensive validation, storage management, recovery
6. **Performance** - Virtual scrolling, compression, animations, keyboard navigation

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 days)
```
TICKET_001 → TICKET_002 → TICKET_003
```
- Core data layer and save functionality
- Basic user flow working

### Phase 2: Navigation (2-3 days)  
```
TICKET_004 → TICKET_005 → TICKET_007
```
- Dataset list and management UI
- Load functionality complete

### Phase 3: Enhancement (3-4 days)
```
TICKET_006 → TICKET_008 → TICKET_009
```
- Advanced features and robustness
- Performance and polish

## Total Effort Estimate
**59 hours** across 9 tickets

## Key Dependencies
- **Zustand** - State management with persistence
- **Shadcn UI** - Existing UI component library
- **React Window** - Virtual scrolling (TICKET_009)
- **Framer Motion** - Animations (TICKET_009)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- TICKET_001-005: Standard CRUD operations and UI components
- TICKET_007: Playground integration using existing patterns

### Medium Risk  
- TICKET_006: Complex batch operations and multiple file formats
- TICKET_008: Storage quota handling across different browsers

### High Risk
- TICKET_009: Performance optimizations may require significant refactoring

## Success Metrics

- Datasets persist across browser sessions
- Dataset list supports 100+ items without performance issues
- Import/export works with multiple formats
- System gracefully handles storage limits and errors
- All functionality accessible via keyboard navigation

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Cloud sync for datasets
- Sharing datasets between users
- Dataset versioning and history
- AI-powered dataset recommendations
- Integration with external data sources
